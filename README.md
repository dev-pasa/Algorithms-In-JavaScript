### Learning Algorithms in JavaScript

- Practice a set of coding challenges and try to solve them in JavaScript. The goal is to learn algorithms using JavaScript. This is my learning experience using a loosely typed language. 

### My primary focus will be on two main things:
- ` Correctness: The data structure should correctly implement its interface. Use testing for validation and also try to include separtion of concerts for better algorithm pattern.`
- `Time complexity: The running times of operations on the data structure should be as small as possible.`
